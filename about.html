        <h1>What is SmartMove ?</h1>
        <p>
          SmartMove is an application which enables people to move from one place
          to another.
          Many others sites as the SNCF's one in France provide this kind of service.
          However, they sometimes tend to be very difficult to use, and to find...<br/>
          Here is our innovation: a simple interface where people of every age and
          abilities can easily search for the information they need. <br/>
          <br>
          <strong>How to use it? </strong><br/>
          You type your departure in the first field, and your
          final destination in the next one. <br/>
          Tip: You can also put nothing in the first field text and accept that
          Google determines your current position: in this way, you are searching
          for a way from where you are to where you want to go.<br/>
          Then, if you click on the submit button, you can see in the google map
          the path from the departure to the arrival.<br/>
          In the tabs above the map, you can choose the way to go: by bus, by car
          and on foot. On the right side, we can see the information about the
          CO<sub>2</sub>, the time it takes to travel, etc.

        <h1>Technologies involved</h1>
        <p>
          Smartmove uses actually a extensive set of techniques and technologies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML5: of course, Smartmove relies on the best markup possible: clear,
            semantic, and valid !
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS3: we tried to implement some  CSS3 features like <i>border-radius</i>
           or <i>text-shadow</i>, to enhance the Smartmove experience
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML5BoilerPlate: initiated by Paul Irish, <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com" title="HTML5BoilerPlate">this open source project</a>
            aims at providing a solid base for HTML5-cross-browser-compatible websites.
            HTML5BoilerPlate comes with a lot of techniques and ressources. We didn't use them all of course.
          </li>
          <li>
            Google Map API v3: our main data source.
          </li>
          <li>GitHub: a web-based Distributed Control Version System, which enabled a collaborative work on the project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What does Smartmove does so far ?</h1>
        <p>
         The functions that comes with Smartmove today: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visually trace the route from a place to another</li>
          <li>Automatic geolocation in case the first field in untouched</li>
          <li>Update of the information according to the mean of transport chosen
            via the tabs <br/>-- well, with fake data for know --
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>The limits we encountered</h1>
        <p>
         When we let the current location at its default value, once we submit it,
         the javascript didn't have time to execute as the page reloaded itself.<br/>
         So the map doesn't display properly the current user's location
         (even if he accepted to let the browser know it in the first place).
         We fixed the bug by geolocalising the user when the page loads.
